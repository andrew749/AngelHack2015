# Panic.io
Panic.io uses the power of friendship to keep you safe. Walking alone in a sketchy neighbourhood? Would you rather have a really close friend/family member keep a watch on you for a short while? Just press a button on Panic.io and your pre-set contacts are sent a link of your live location. All tracking stops when you click "all clear".
